    "The method was upgraded from just extracting quotes to now getting both speakers and quotes. Originally, it only found text within quotation marks, missing who said it. To fix this, adjustments were made to the pattern. By adding named groups for speakers and quotes, it could now identify both. The speaker group grabs names like \"Justin Trudeau\", while the quote group captures the actual text in the quotes. With each match, the function separates speakers and quotes, giving a clearer picture of who said what. This upgrade makes the method more useful for understanding the text's content.\n"

      "A claim the city's debt is higher than city reports say it is could support a total of $135 million in proposed cuts to the previous administration's projects, including the $58 million Grandview Heights Community Centre and Library.\n",
      "A claim the costs of building a SkyTrain extension to Langley are lower than TransLink says they are could make one of McCallum's two big-ticket promises, SkyTrain and a municipal police force, more attractive.\n",
      "Some voters say he is already losing their trust.\n",
      "But observers say there may be a method to McCallum’s messages.\n",
      "So I think there’s an element of that kind of gamesmanship going on,” University of the Fraser Valley political scientist Hamish Telford said.\n",
      "“Then there’s the fact that McCallum has been out of office for quite some time, thinking he knew the job, but some things have changed,” Telford said.\n",
      "McCallum claimed in that speech the cost could be reduced if the construction was done 24/7, which may be possible, though it could lead to substantial disruptions along the route for the public.\n",
      "But the mayor claimed a study had been done to confirm this by TransLink.\n",
      "The most recent cost estimate (2017 Hatch report) did not consider construction schedules,” a spokesperson said.\n",
      "“We’ve also said in the past if we let large construction jobs build seven days a week, around the clock, we can reduce costs considerably,” he said.\n",
      "When told of TransLink’s statement they had never done a study, he said, “I’ve never said there’s a study.”.\n",
      "McCallum has said the Fraser Highway extension could be built affordably for the funding envelope that had already been approved for the LRT, at $1.65 billion.\n",
      "TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond said Thursday one of McCallum's suggestions, to find places where the line could not be elevated, could save money.\n",
      "But coming up with lower lengths, and therefore lower costs, could be part of the mayor’s attempts to make the SkyTrain extension seem more attractive, said Telford.\n",
      "“I think he’s trying to present the best possible case that he can fulfill his promises without too much financial pain, and to put it generously, he’s reading the spreadsheets optimistically,” Telford said.\n",
      "McCallum’s staff later said the $514 million figure he was referring to was the debt load the city is expected to take on over five years of building projects, which by definition is money that hasn't been spent yet.\n",
      "When asked on Dec. 13 whether he was overstating the city’s debt, McCallum said, “The city’s debt as far as the City of Surrey is $514 million, that’s in the financial statements, in the public documents that have gone out.\n",
      "We have the three new ones coming along with the current ones,” he said.\n",
      "Claims about the Cloverdale complex costs.\n",
      "McCallum also claimed of the Cloverdale Sport and Ice Complex, “The land underneath is very unstable.\n",
      "Our engineering department says we would not be able to build this on unstable ground unless we used pile driving techniques to build it.\n",
      "In fact, the original cost of the Cloverdale complex was $35 million, city documents say.\n",
      "The mayor also claimed that the enrolment of young people in ice sports was dropping – another justification for cutting the construction of the Cloverdale complex.\n",
      "“I know that our arenas are used more than what’s listed in that graph,” said Cindy Secord, who sits on the Ice Allocation Committee.\n",

    "This Python script automates the extraction of indirect quotes from multiple text files stored in the `A1_data` directory. It relies on the spaCy library, which helps understand the structure of text. The key function, `extract_indirect_quotes_from_file`, uses spaCy to find verbs indicating speech (like \"say\" or \"claim\") in each sentence of a text file and extracts the associated reported speech. The script then loops through each file in the directory, applies the extraction function, and prints out the indirect quotes found. This streamlined approach makes it easier to analyze the language used in the texts without having to manually search through each file.\n",
